# Development Guide

Welcome to the **VeriSynth Core** developer guide.  
This document walks you through setting up your local environment, running the CLI, writing tests, and contributing to the project.

VeriSynth Core is fully open source (MIT licensed) and welcomes community contributions.

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verisynth/verisynth-core.git
cd verisynth-core
````

---

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

We recommend using **Python 3.10+** and a virtual environment for isolation.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development (with linting, testing, and docs):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## 4. Project Structure

├── README.md
├── setup.py / pyproject.toml
└── requirements.txt
```

---

## 5. Run the CLI (Development Mode)

You can run VeriSynth directly from source:

```bash
python -m verisynth.cli data/sample_patients.csv -o out/ --rows 1000
```

Or after install:

```bash
verisynth data/sample_patients.csv -o out/ --rows 1000
```

---

## 6. Testing

We use **pytest** as our primary testing framework.

Run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Run a single test file:

```bash
pytest tests/test_synth.py -v
```

To see coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=verisynth --cov-report=term-missing
```

---

## 7. Contributing

We welcome pull requests from the community!

**Basic PR process:**

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`feature/add-metrics`, `fix/cli-output`, etc.)
3. Commit cleanly with clear messages
4. Run `pytest` before pushing
5. Submit your PR and link to any related issue

Example commit:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-proof-verifier
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added local proof verification"
git push origin feature/add-proof-verifier
```

---

## 8. Publishing (for Maintainers)

Tag a release:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial public release"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Build and upload to PyPI:

```bash
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

---

## 9. Development Roadmap
