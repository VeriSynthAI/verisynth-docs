# Quickstart

Let‚Äôs generate your first **verifiable synthetic dataset** ‚Äî right from your terminal.

VeriSynth runs 100% locally, needs **no GPU**, and produces both a **synthetic dataset** and a **cryptographic proof receipt** for auditability.

---

## 1. Install VeriSynth Core

```bash
pip install verisynth-core
```

That‚Äôs all you need. VeriSynth ships as a self-contained Python package with zero external dependencies beyond standard data libraries.

---

## 2. Prepare your dataset

Start with any CSV file ‚Äî for example, a small tabular dataset of patients, transactions, or IoT readings.

```bash
data/patients.csv
```

Example data:

| patient_id | age | bmi  | smoker | hba1c | systolic_bp | diastolic_bp |
| ---------- | --- | ---- | ------ | ----- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 001        | 62  | 31.4 | 1      | 7.8   | 148         | 90           |
| 002        | 45  | 28.6 | 0      | 6.1   | 132         | 82           |
| 003        | 33  | 24.1 | 0      | 5.3   | 116         | 74           |

You can also grab sample data here: https://github.com/VeriSynthAI/verisynth-core/tree/main/data

## 3. Generate synthetic data

Run VeriSynth directly from the CLI:

```bash
verisynth data/patients.csv -o out/ --rows 1000000 --seed 42
```

‚úÖ This will produce two files:

```
üìÅ out/synthetic.csv   # Synthetic dataset
üßæ out/proof.json      # Cryptographic proof receipt
```

---

## 4. Inspect the proof receipt

Each run creates a verifiable JSON proof describing:

- Dataset hashes (SHA-256)
- Model configuration (Gaussian Copula)
- Random seed (for reproducibility)
- Privacy and correlation metrics
- Merkle root for integrity checking

Example:

```json
{
  "verisynth_version": "core-0.1.0",
  "metrics": { "corr_mean_abs_delta": 0.12, "naive_reid_risk": 0.01 },
  "input":  { "rows": 10, "sha256": "‚Ä¶82b7" },
  "output": { "rows": 1000000, "sha256": "‚Ä¶acb9" },
  "proof": "merkle_root: ‚Ä¶c31"
}
```

---

## 5. Explore your synthetic dataset

The generated data preserves the **statistical structure** of your original dataset ‚Äî correlations, distributions, and realistic relationships ‚Äî without containing any real records.

Try viewing it in pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("out/synthetic.csv")
df.head()
```

---

## 6. Reproduce your results

Because VeriSynth uses deterministic seeding (`--seed`), you can always reproduce the exact same synthetic dataset and proof receipt from the same input file.

```bash
verisynth data/patients.csv -o out/ --rows 1000000 --seed 42
```

Running this command again, with the same `seed` value will yield **identical Merkle roots and metrics**, proving the process is verifiable and consistent.
