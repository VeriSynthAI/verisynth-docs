# 📘 VeriSynth Documentation

Welcome to the **official documentation** for **[VeriSynth.ai](https://verisynth.ai)** — the open-source framework for **verifiable synthetic data**.

These docs are built using **[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/)** and maintained by the VeriSynth community.

## 🧩 What is VeriSynth?

VeriSynth turns sensitive datasets into **privacy-safe synthetic data** with **cryptographic proof receipts** — enabling teams to share, analyze, and train AI models on realistic data **without exposing real individuals**.
