# CLI Testing & Verification

The **VeriSynth CLI** was designed for trust — every run can be **verified**, **reproduced**, and **audited** without ever exposing sensitive data.

This guide explains how to:
- Test VeriSynth locally  
- Verify your proof receipts  
- Reproduce a run deterministically  
- Debug unexpected differences

---

## 1. Verify Installation

After installation, confirm that the CLI is available:

```bash
verisynth --version
````

Expected output:

```
VeriSynth Core v0.1.0
```

Run the built-in help command:

```bash
verisynth --help
```

If both commands succeed, your environment is ready.

---

## 2. Generate a Test Dataset

Use the included demo dataset for a quick local test:

```bash
verisynth data/sample_patients.csv -o out/ --rows 1000 --seed 42
```

Output:

```
📁 out/synthetic.csv
🧾 out/proof.json
```

The CLI will also print a short summary:

```
VeriSynth — Synthetic Data Report
========================================
Input: data/sample_patients.csv
Output: out/synthetic.csv
Engine: GaussianCopula | Seed: 42
Fidelity: corr Δ=0.23 | Privacy risk=0.0
Proof: out/proof.json (Merkle verified)
```

---

## 3. Validate the Proof Receipt

Each run produces a JSON proof receipt (`proof.json`):

```json
{
  "verisynth_version": "core-0.1.0",
  "input":  { "rows": 10, "sha256": "…82b7" },
  "output": { "rows": 1000000, "sha256": "…acb9" },
  "metrics": { "corr_mean_abs_delta": 0.12, "naive_reid_risk": 0.01 },
  "proof": "merkle_root: …c31"
}
```

To validate integrity:

1. Compute your own SHA-256 hash of the input and output files.
2. Compare them with the hashes inside `proof.json`.
3. Verify that the Merkle root matches — if it does, your run is **provably unchanged**.

*(The upcoming `verisynth verify` command will automate this.)*

---

## 4. Test Reproducibility

Because VeriSynth uses deterministic seeding, identical runs will produce identical proofs and Merkle roots.

Try it:

```bash
verisynth data/sample_patients.csv -o out1/ --rows 1000 --seed 42
verisynth data/sample_patients.csv -o out2/ --rows 1000 --seed 42
```

Compare both proofs:

```bash
diff out1/proof.json out2/proof.json
```

Expected:

```
(no differences)
```

This confirms full reproducibility — a cornerstone of VeriSynth’s trust model.

## 5. Test Edge Cases

You can test various parameters to ensure consistent behavior:

| Scenario           | Command                         | Expected Result                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Small input file   | `--rows 100`                    | Completes instantly               |
| Large output       | `--rows 1000000`                | Slower, but deterministic         |
| Custom output path | `--proof out/custom_proof.json` | Proof saved to custom path        |
| Invalid path       | wrong file                      | Clean error message (exit code 1) |

---

## 6. Exit Codes

The CLI provides predictable exit codes for scripting and CI/CD.

| Code | Meaning                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------- |
| `0`  | Success                       |
| `1`  | Invalid input or missing file |
| `2`  | Model synthesis error         |
| `3`  | Proof verification failed     |
| `4`  | I/O or permission issue       |

---

## 7. Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

You can run VeriSynth tests automatically as part of your pipeline.

Example GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: pip install pytest pytest-cov
      - run: pytest --cov=verisynth
```

## 8. Debugging Tips

| Issue                    | Cause                             | Fix                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `CLI not found`          | PATH not updated                  | Reinstall with `pip install -e .`      |
| `Permission denied`      | Output folder restricted          | Use `--output` in a writable directory |
| `Metrics missing`        | Proof disabled                    | Remove `--no-proof` flag               |
| Non-deterministic output | Different seeds or model versions | Use `--seed` consistently              |

---

## Summary

CLI testing in VeriSynth confirms three pillars of trust:

1. **Reproducibility** — identical seeds = identical outputs
2. **Integrity** — proof receipts and Merkle roots verify correctness
3. **Privacy** — synthetic data is generated without copying real data
