# CLI Commands

The **VeriSynth CLI** is a lightweight, Python-based command-line interface for generating synthetic datasets and producing verifiable proof receipts.

All commands run **offline** and are designed to integrate easily with Python, CI/CD pipelines, and local analytics workflows.

---

## Base Command: `verisynth`

The base command generates synthetic data and outputs both:
- A **synthetic dataset** (`synthetic.csv`)
- A **proof receipt** (`proof.json`)

```bash
verisynth <input_csv> -o <output_dir> [options]
````

Example:

```bash
verisynth data/patients.csv -o out/ --rows 1000000 --seed 42
```

Output:

```
📁 out/synthetic.csv
🧾 out/proof.json
```

Result summary:

```

## Example Workflows

### Generate 1M rows from a healthcare dataset

```bash
verisynth data/patients.csv -o out/ --rows 1000000 --seed 42
```

### Disable proof generation (for benchmarking only)

```bash
verisynth data/patients.csv -o out/ --rows 50000 --no-proof
```

### Use a different model (future feature)

```bash
verisynth data/transactions.csv -o out/ --model ctgan --rows 250000
```

---

## `verisynth verify` *(planned)*

Verifies a previously generated `proof.json` file against your input and output datasets.

```bash
verisynth verify out/proof.json
```

Example output:

```
Verifying proof.json ...
✅ Merkle roots match
✅ Input/output hashes verified
✅ Metrics within tolerance

Result: VERIFIED (deterministic run)
```

Use this to confirm that a shared synthetic dataset and proof receipt haven’t been altered since generation.

---

## `verisynth inspect` *(planned)*

Display summary statistics and correlations from a synthetic dataset.

```bash
verisynth inspect out/synthetic.csv
```

Example:

```
Summary of out/synthetic.csv
Rows: 1000000
Columns: 12
Fidelity metrics:
  - Mean correlation Δ: 0.18
  - Privacy risk (naive re-ID): 0.0
Generated: 2025-10-16T00:23:54Z
```

---

## `verisynth api` *(planned)*

Serve the synthesis engine via a local REST API using FastAPI.

```bash
verisynth api --port 8080
```

This exposes an endpoint:

```
POST /synthesize
{
  "input_path": "data/patients.csv",
  "rows": 10000,
  "seed": 42
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "synthetic_path": "out/synthetic.csv",
  "proof_path": "out/proof.json",
  "metrics": { "corr_delta": 0.23, "risk": 0.0 }
}
```

---

## `verisynth test` *(planned)*

Run internal diagnostic tests on the installed VeriSynth environment.

```bash
verisynth test
```

Checks:

* Model availability
* Proof library integrity
* Dependency compatibility
* CLI version sync

## CLI Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Success                                  |
| `1`  | General error (e.g., invalid input path) |
| `2`  | Model training failure                   |
| `3`  | Proof verification failure               |
| `4`  | I/O or file permission error             |
