description: Overview of the VeriSynth command-line interface (CLI) for generating verifiable synthetic data.

# Introduction

The **VeriSynth CLI** provides a simple, reproducible way to generate privacy-safe synthetic datasets from the command line.

It‚Äôs ideal for:
- Data scientists who want to quickly synthesize CSV datasets  
- Privacy engineers who need deterministic, verifiable runs  
- Developers integrating VeriSynth into pipelines, notebooks, or CI/CD  

---

## Why a CLI?

VeriSynth was designed to **run locally** and **without external dependencies**.  
The CLI lets you:
- Generate synthetic datasets in seconds  
- Produce cryptographic proof receipts automatically  
- Reproduce any previous run using deterministic seeding  
- Integrate into any pipeline (Bash, Airflow, CI/CD, notebooks, etc.)

You own the data ‚Äî VeriSynth never sends it to the cloud.

## Quick Example

```bash
verisynth data/patients.csv -o out/ --rows 1000000 --seed 42
````

Output:

```
üìÅ out/synthetic.csv   # Synthetic dataset
üßæ out/proof.json      # Cryptographic proof receipt
```

Result summary:
