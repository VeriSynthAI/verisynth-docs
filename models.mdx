# Models in VeriSynth

VeriSynth uses machine learning models to learn the **statistical structure** of real data and generate **synthetic data** that behaves like the real world ‚Äî without exposing sensitive records.

Each model is designed to balance **realism**, **privacy**, and **computational efficiency**.  
The system is modular, so users can plug in new synthesis engines over time.

---

## Current Model: Gaussian Copula (GC)

The **Gaussian Copula Synthesizer** is the first and default model in VeriSynth Core.  
It‚Äôs a fast, deterministic, and lightweight model for **tabular synthetic data** ‚Äî perfect for most structured datasets.

### How It Works

1. **Learn relationships**  
   GC learns pairwise correlations between all columns in your dataset.  
   It transforms them into a continuous Gaussian space where relationships are easier to model.

2. **Model dependencies**  
   A multivariate Gaussian distribution is fit to the transformed data.  
   This captures how each variable depends on others (e.g., *age ‚Üî BMI ‚Üî blood pressure*).

3. **Sample synthetic data**  
   New synthetic samples are drawn from this learned distribution, then mapped back to the original data space.

4. **Output verification**  
   The generated dataset is post-processed and evaluated for correlation deltas, privacy risk, and consistency metrics.

### Example

Let‚Äôs say your real dataset has these correlations:

| Variable Pair | Correlation |
|----------------|-------------|
| Age ‚Üî BMI | 0.42 |
| BMI ‚Üî Systolic BP | 0.61 |
| Age ‚Üî Glucose | 0.58 |

The synthetic dataset produced by VeriSynth will preserve these relationships closely, often within a **correlation delta of ¬±0.1** ‚Äî enough to be statistically realistic for most analytical and ML tasks.

> Instead of random noise, GC learns your dataset‚Äôs *statistical DNA* and regenerates it faithfully.

### Strengths

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Lightweight** | Runs entirely on CPU ‚Äî no GPUs required |
| **Deterministic** | Same seed ‚Üí same result, ideal for reproducibility |
| **Explainable** | Transparent mathematical model (no black box) |
| **Fast** | Generates up to 1M+ rows in seconds |
| **Auditable** | Outputs proof receipts with correlation metrics |

---

### Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Linear correlations only** | GC struggles with nonlinear or multimodal relationships |
| **Limited categorical complexity** | High-cardinality categories may be oversimplified |
| **No temporal or sequential modeling** | Best for static, tabular datasets |

---

## Roadmap: Upcoming Models

VeriSynth Core is model-agnostic ‚Äî future releases will expand into **deep generative** and **privacy-enhanced** models.

| Model | Type | Status | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| **CTGAN** | GAN-based tabular | üß© Planned | Captures nonlinear relationships and rare categories |
| **TVAE** | Variational Autoencoder | üß© Planned | Produces smoother synthetic distributions and uncertainty estimates |
| **DP-GC** | Differentially Private Gaussian Copula | üß© Planned | Adds formal privacy bounds (Œµ) to correlation modeling |
| **TimeSynth** | Sequential/time-series | üß© Planned | Models synthetic patient timelines, transactions, or sensor data |
| **ImageSynth** | Generative Vision | üöß Exploratory | Extends proof-based synthesis to visual data |

## Model Selection Philosophy

We believe every synthetic data generator should be:

1. **Understandable** ‚Äî transparent about how it learns and samples  
2. **Reproducible** ‚Äî deterministic seeds, reproducible metrics  
3. **Verifiable** ‚Äî accompanied by measurable fidelity and privacy proofs  
4. **Modular** ‚Äî easy to swap models as new techniques evolve  

VeriSynth is built as a **modular framework**, so you can run:
```bash
verisynth data/patients.csv -o out/ --model gaussian_copula
# (future)
verisynth data/patients.csv -o out/ --model ctgan
````

---

## Model Registry (Coming Soon)

We‚Äôre working on a **model registry system** that will let users:

* View available models (`verisynth models list`)
* Inspect metadata, dependencies, and required hardware
* Register custom synthesis engines via plugin
* Benchmark models on fidelity vs privacy

Example:

```bash
verisynth models list
# ‚Üí gaussian_copula, ctgan, tvae, dp_gc
```

---

## Model Validation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:

| Metric                           | Description                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Correlation delta (Œî)**        | Measures difference in variable relationships      |
| **KS test (p-value)**            | Checks distributional similarity                   |
| **Naive re-identification risk** | Approximates privacy exposure                      |
| **Synthetic utility**            | Performance of ML models trained on synthetic data |

These metrics are logged to `proof.json` for transparency and reproducibility.

## Example CLI Run (GC Model)

```bash
verisynth data/finance.csv -o out/ --rows 50000 --model gaussian_copula --seed 42
```

Produces:

```
üìÅ out/synthetic.csv
üßæ out/proof.json
```

With proof:

```json
{
  "model": { "engine": "gaussian_copula", "seed": 42 },
  "metrics": { "corr_mean_abs_delta": 0.15, "naive_reid_risk": 0.0 }
}
```

## Summary

| Principle           | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start simple**    | GC gives accurate, transparent tabular synthesis                        |
| **Build modularly** | New models can plug into the same proof pipeline                        |
| **Stay verifiable** | Every model, no matter how complex, will always produce a proof receipt |
